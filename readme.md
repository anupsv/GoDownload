# GoDownload

GoDownload is a robust and concurrent file downloader written in Go. It allows users to download multiple files simultaneously, leveraging Go's goroutines for efficient and fast downloads. The downloader supports progress bars for each download, ensuring users are always informed about the status of their downloads.

## Features

- **Concurrent Downloads**: Download multiple files simultaneously.
- **Progress Bars**: Real-time progress bars for each download.
- **URL Validation**: Ensures only valid URLs are processed.
- **File Existence Check**: Skips downloading if the file already exists.
- **Graceful Exit**: Handles `CTRL+C` gracefully, ensuring all goroutines exit properly.

To install GoDownload, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Once you have Go set up:

```bash
